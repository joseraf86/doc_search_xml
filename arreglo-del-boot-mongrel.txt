OK, here's ONE answer. I got mongrel to boot...but it's hacky, and doesn't solve the real problem...but at least for NOW I can get back to work on this project.

Here's what I did...YES..it's HACKY.

I edited the file throwing the error...dependencies.rb

I added a hook to call out the specific path to mongrel rails if that was the file it was trying to load.

def load(file, *extras) #:nodoc:

if file == "mongrel_rails"
  file ="/usr/bin/mongrel_rails" #pon la ruta de tu mongrel
end
Dependencies.new_constants_in(Object) { super(file, *extras) }
  rescue Exception => exception  # errors from loading file
  exception.blame_file! file
  raise
end

Again, I would really like to fix the underlying problem here...but this at least let me boot up.
